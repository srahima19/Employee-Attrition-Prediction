## ✅ Project Structure

### 🔍 Part 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Total employees and number who left
- Average age comparison
- Department-wise attrition rates
- Correlation: Distance from home
- OverTime and Monthly Income impact
- Missing values check

### 📊 Part 2 – Visualizations
- Attrition counts
- Monthly Income vs Attrition (boxplot)
- Age distribution (histogram)
- Department vs Attrition (stacked bar)
- Job Satisfaction vs Attrition (countplot)
- Correlation heatmap

### 🤖 Part 3 – Machine Learning Models
- Categorical encoding
- Feature preparation and train-test split
- Models trained:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluations:
  - Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
  - ROC Curve and AUC Score

---

## 📈 Key Results

- OverTime and JobSatisfaction were major factors in attrition.
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in most metrics.
- Visuals helped uncover patterns between income, age, department, and attrition.
